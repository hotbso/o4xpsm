This is a Scenery so it must go into "Custom Sceneries" !!
==========================================================

- it tweaks vegetation of XP12, Global Forests v2 + Simheaven
- it "overlays" -> it does NOT change the above-mentioned sceneries

It is very obscure when and to what extent XP rereads sceneries so after a
change of date the vegetation often does NOT yet reflect the selected date.
Another "Reload Scenerey" is often necessary.

o4xp_Seasons_Manager with the embedded plugin caches the current date + state on disk
and loads this data after start of X-Plane. So if you select a different date after startup
of X-Plane you get some mixed visuals.

Therefore o4xp_Seasons_Manager works best when you mostly fly with real time.
You get a smooth transition from flight to flight.

Installation
============
- if you have gfsm installed, remove it and revert GFv2 to its original state
- drop the zip into "Custom Sceneries"
- run the o4xpsm_install.exe or o4xpsm_install.py (when Python 3.x is installed)
  - it scans for supported sceneries and creates appropriate links
  - it does NOT alter the other sceneries
- start X Plane and a flight
- enable "Ortho Mode" in the plugins menu
- stop X-Plane
- move the line with "o4xp_Seasons_Manager" just below "SCENERY_PACK *GLOBAL_AIRPORTS*"
  it must be ABOVE simHeaven_X-World_Vegetation_Library and Global_Forests_v2
